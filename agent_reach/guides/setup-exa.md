# Exa Search Setup Guide

## Feature Overview
Exa is an AI semantic search engine. Integrated via MCP — **free, no API Key required**. Unlocks:
- Web-wide semantic search
- Reddit search (via site:reddit.com)
- Twitter search (via site:x.com)

## Steps the Agent Can Complete Automatically

`agent-reach install --env=auto` will complete the following steps automatically; manual action is usually not needed.

### 1. Install mcporter
```bash
npm install -g mcporter
```

### 2. Register Exa MCP
```bash
mcporter config add exa https://mcp.exa.ai/mcp
```

### 3. Verify
```bash
agent-reach doctor | grep "Search"
mcporter call 'exa.web_search_exa(query: "test", numResults: 1)'
```

## Steps Requiring Manual User Action

**None.** Exa is integrated via MCP — free, no registration, no API key required.

If `agent-reach install` did not configure Exa automatically due to network issues, just run the two commands above manually.

## FAQ

A: The MCP endpoint is provided by Exa (mcp.exa.ai) and is currently free and unlimited. If this changes in the future, agent-reach will be updated to accommodate.

**Q: What is mcporter?**
A: A command-line bridge tool for the MCP protocol, used to call MCP Servers. Agent Reach uses it to connect to Exa and XiaoHongShu.
